            In the middle of the journey of our life I found myself within a dark woods where the straight way was lost. Ah, how hard a thing it is to tell what was this forest savage, dense, and harsh, which in the very thought renews the fear! It is so bitter, death is little more; but to treat of the good which I found there, I will speak of the other things I saw there. I cannot well say how I entered it, so full was I of sleep at the moment I left the true way. But when I had reached a mountainâ€™s foot, at that point where the valley terminated, I looked on high and saw its shoulders clothed with the rays of that planet which leads all on the right way; then was my fear a little quieted. What else I saw there, I will tell in the following song.
